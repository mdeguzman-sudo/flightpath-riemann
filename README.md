# Flight Path Distance Estimation Using Riemann Sums

This interactive widget helps students explore numerical integration and motion estimation in a drone obstacle course.  
They record stopwatch times at six gates (red, yellow, blue) and view how Riemann sums approximate total flight distance.

## Features
- Stopwatch-friendly data entry for t₀–t₆.
- Color-coded gates: Red (1–2), Yellow (3–4), Blue (5–6), Landing.
- Visual Left and Right Riemann sum rectangles (blue/red).
- Automatic calculation of Δt, average speed, and sum estimates.
- Works entirely offline or via GitHub Pages.

## Classroom Use
Designed for Calculus B and STEM demonstrations linking physical drone motion with numerical integration concepts.
